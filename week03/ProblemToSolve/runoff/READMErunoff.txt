Understand the code in runoff.c

Whenever you’ll extend the functionality of existing code, it’s best to be sure you first understand it in its present state.

Look at the top of runoff.c first. Two constants are defined: MAX_CANDIDATES for the maximum number of candidates in the election, and MAX_VOTERS for the maximum number of voters in the election.

// Max voters and candidates
#define MAX_VOTERS 100
#define MAX_CANDIDATES 9

Notice that MAX_CANDIDATES is used to size an array, candidates.

// Array of candidates
candidate candidates[MAX_CANDIDATES];

candidates is an array of candidates. In runoff.c a candidate is a struct. Every candidate has a string field for their name, an int representing the number of votes they currently have, and a bool value called eliminated that indicates whether the candidate has been eliminated from the election. The array candidates will keep track of all of the candidates in the election.

// Candidates have name, vote count, eliminated status

typedef struct
{
    string name;
    int votes;
    bool eliminated;
}
candidate;

Now you can better understand preferences, the two-dimensional array. The array preferences[i] will represent all of the preferences for voter number i. The integer, preferences[i][j], will store the index of the candidate, from the candidates array, who is the jth preference for voter i.

// preferences[i][j] is jth preference for voter i
int preferences[MAX_VOTERS][MAX_CANDIDATES];

The program also has two global variables: voter_count and candidate_count.

// Numbers of voters and candidates
int voter_count;
int candidate_count;

Now onto main. Notice that after determining the number of candidates and the number of voters, the main voting loop begins, giving every voter a chance to vote. As the voter enters their preferences, the vote function is called to keep track of all of the preferences. If at any point, the ballot is deemed to be invalid, the program exits.

Once all of the votes are in, another loop begins: this one’s going to keep looping through the runoff process of checking for a winner and eliminating the last place candidate until there is a winner.

The first call here is to a function called tabulate, which should look at all of the voters’ preferences and compute the current vote totals, by looking at each voter’s top choice candidate who hasn’t yet been eliminated. Next, the print_winner function should print out the winner if there is one; if there is, the program is over. But otherwise, the program needs to determine the fewest number of votes anyone still in the election received (via a call to find_min). If it turns out that everyone in the election is tied with the same number of votes (as determined by the is_tie function), the election is declared a tie; otherwise, the last-place candidate (or candidates) is eliminated from the election via a call to the eliminate function.

If you look a bit further down in the file, you’ll see that the rest of the functions—vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate—are all left to up to you to complete! You should only modify these functions in runoff.c, though you may #include additional header files atop runoff.c if you’d like

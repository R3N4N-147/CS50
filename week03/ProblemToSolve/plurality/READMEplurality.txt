Plurality
Problem to Solve
Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the Prime Minister is officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step Electoral College process where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.

Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

For this problem, you’ll implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.


Distribution Code
For this problem, you’ll extend the functionality of “distribution code” provided to you by CS50’s staff.

Download the distribution code
Log into cs50.dev, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

Next execute

wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2024/fall/psets/3/plurality.zip
in order to download a ZIP called plurality.zip into your codespace.

Then execute

unzip plurality.zip
to create a folder called plurality. You no longer need the ZIP file, so you can execute

rm plurality.zip
and respond with “y” followed by Enter at the prompt to remove the ZIP file you downloaded.

Now type

cd plurality
followed by Enter to move yourself into (i.e., open) that directory. Your prompt should now resemble the below.

plurality/ $
If all was successful, you should execute

ls

and see a file named plurality.c. Executing code plurality.c should open the file where you will type your code for this problem set. If not, retrace your steps and see if you can determine where you went wrong!
